// Arithmetic Operators

let a = 10
let b = 3
let sum = a + b
let difference = a - b
let product = a * b
let division = a / b
let remainder = a % b // Modulus operator gives the remainder of the division

let exponentiation = a ** b // Exponentiation operator raises a to the power of b

//console.log(exponentiation)

// Comparison Operators
let number = 10
let numberTwo = '10'

//console.log(number == numberTwo) // Loose equality (==) checks for value only, not type
//console.log(number === numberTwo) // Strict equality (===) checks for value and type



let z = 3
let w = 14
let d = '14'

console.log(w != z) // Loose inequality (!=) checks for value only, not type
console.log(w != d) // Loose inequality (!=) checks for value and type
console.log(w !== d) // Strict inequality (!==) checks for value and type

console.log(w > z) // Greater than operator
console.log(w < z) // Less than operator
console.log(w >= z) // Greater than or equal to operator
console.log(w <= z) // Less than or equal to operator
